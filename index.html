      <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
          I love to explore all avenues of life. From physical movement and objects, to imaginary places and things. Life 
          is abundantly providing us plenty of oppurtunities to fullfill ourselves and each other. I believe, that the more open minded we are 
          in regards to how we view our circumstances. The more we increase our appetite for knowledge which will empower ourselves to further
          engage with life and our environment. Allowing us to contribute to, and facilitate the most satisfying expiriences possible.   
        </p>
        <p>
          One important pattern I've recognized in my life is the formula to success. We must be passionate about our presence. Life is a gift
          and every moment is waiting for us to unwrap it's beauty. We must be committed. It's important to never give up. Overcoming challenges
          is the most satisfying expirience, why would anyone give up? Education, there is no end to what you can learn and improve. The amount of 
          beauty and knowledge in anything is infinite. It is also very important to be consistent and never waiver from your goals. These are 
          just a few principals that have helped find success in many avenues of my life.
